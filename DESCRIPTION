Description: 
  Allowing simple and quick reconstruction of lineage tracing data with maximum likelihood framework.
  The number of state should be less than 10 and number of site should not exceed 1000.
  We also provide a simulation framework for quick understanding of the input requirement.It specialized in detailed 
  modelling of lineage tracing experiment with generation time as basic unit of edge length and fixed tree height as fixed duration
