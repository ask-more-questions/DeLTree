#### Lineage Tree with discrete edge length
Here we introduce a discrete time model to account for the synchronous process of clonal expansion and barcode evolution with a Maximum Likelihood framework. Previous literature of stem cell development has introduced a single-cell-based mathematical model of harmatopoietic stem cell with a model define on cell-cycle time, where within this model ,stem cell are able to swich reversibly between two characteristic states: proliferating (i.e. in phase G1, S, G2, or M of the cell cycle) and quiescent (i.e. in G0). Corresponding to this project as bifurcation and non bifurcation edges per generation time. Hence, we model over the cellular geneaology as discrete branching process. For proliferation-active cells like zygote or stem cells, We uses the Galton-Watson process to model over the process of  clonal expansion starting from a single progenitor cell after fixed generations. Compared with continuous-time branching process like birth death model used in population dynamics.The Galton-Watson process provides can incorporate the fixed duration of the tracing experiment and provdies intuitive understanding of the edge length as generation time in the reconstructed tree
